# studentPerformance_Report

## Overview

For this project I read in a directory of JSON files representing individual students, performed some calculations, and wrote the results out to a text file. I switched it up and used VSCODE to write the program which made things a bit more easier to organize compared with the shell. 

The code in the main.py script is a bit "brute force." I jumped ahead in the ProgrammingExpert.io course and thought I would tackle another project because I felt myself getting stuck in the tutorial zone - i.e. learning a lot of new concepts, but not having much opportunity to practice them. I call it "brute force" because the program felt verbose at times and no doubt takes up quite a few computer resources to execute. As I moved through the more advanced concepts in the course I will look to implement optimizations where necessary - using decorators, iterators, *args & **kwargs, etc. 

## Future Considerations

I am going to optimize the code as I move through the advanced concepts in the PE course. I think it would also be cool to add a 'timer' decorator and compared how long it takes the program to output the text file in the program's current state compared with the time it will take under a few optimizations. As I was looking at the code before uploading it to GitHub I had some ideas percolating...
